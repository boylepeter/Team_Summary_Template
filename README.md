# Team Summary Template

## Description: 
Given the task of creating an application which would enable a manager to create a page with both general and specific information about a team, we employed a variety of technologies and approaches to provide a quality end product. We utilized HTML, Javascript, and node.js with object oriented programming to develop an app which will meet and exceed all tasks asked of us.
